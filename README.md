# cs311
## Update 7/30/2019
I have for the most part switched to GitLab. Same username. Instead of just code samples, I've actually uploaded my entire lecture contents for CS 311 and CS 400; I am still intermittently making changes to the materials as well.

Code samples for my CS 311 - Object-Oriented Programming course at Wichita State University. This will eventually hold the code samples used in class.
